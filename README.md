# title: portfolio

This project shows you my porfolio. I've created this page to look simple and make it easy to view my background. 

## getting started
When you frist open the page you, notice when you hover over my name, the letters will change to the color red. on the top right you will see that I have a about me, skills, and work. If you click on button, the page will scroll down and lead you to that section. I also have a buttom for my resume. if you click that, it will download my resume file. If you go down to my contact, you will see that I have a link for my linkdin and github. Once you click on that, the page will lead you to that website.

## links
I just bootstrap. I mainly wanted to practice more with pure html css and js.
